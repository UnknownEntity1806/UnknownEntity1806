                <p>A little bit of my works in progress in January. Some might be finished this month. Others are more ideas that are for further in the future.</p>
                <img src="https://file.garden/aE7eugw0EBvaQzOF/blog/2026/cloudydaysketch.webp" alt="Sketch of cloudy layout" >
           <p >First, I am constantly working and thinking about upgrading the website. My idea for version 2.0 is to have the different portfolio categories have their own themed layout. So I have made some sketches for that. Although I will not start actually working on coding version 2.0 until all the pages are up and running in version 1.2.   
                </p>
                <p> Second, I am working on expanding the amount of detail in my drawing from the *Walk in the Forest* universe I made this past November. I really like the colours and everything, but I always seem to give up once I have made 1-2 fairies. I want to try and improve the details in my bigger drawings, so that they become illustrations you can really stare at for a longer time. </p>
               <p>It's hard to see now, but up until now I have included one other fairy and some falling leaves. </p>

               <br>
               <p> Third, I am working on making some more buttons to put on the *ABOUT* page, which will probably also be available on the *FOR YOU* as a freebie. I know that there are a lot of ready made buttons available already. But I like to try and make things for myself ^^</p>
               <p> So, those are the things I am working on this month. As I am also in the process of moving over to the winter-house, it's not a lot. But I wanted to give this update in any case. </p>
