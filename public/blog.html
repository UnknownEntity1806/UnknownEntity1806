          <h3>Work in Progress Feb '26</h3>
          <p>Another month, another update on what is going on behind the scenes.</p>

          <p><em>First,</em> I have been working on finishing up the special @its Cloudy Day gallery. It is now live! You can check it out <a href="/public/CloudyDay/main.html">here</a>. 
          In the last post I shared a sketch of what I wanted the layout to look like. And now it is live! I am really happy with it. Now the next one will be for my fairy-world OCs.</p>

          <img src="https://file.garden/aE7eugw0EBvaQzOF/blog/2026/Scherm%C2%ADafbeelding%202026-02-02%20om%2019.09.20.png" height="200" alt="screenshot of the Cloudy Day gallery" style="padding: 5px; float: right; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/>
          <p><em>Second,</em> I have downloaded Pixel Studio for my iPad and worked on some 88x31 buttons for my About page, which are now also available for you to use through the <a href="/public/for-you.html#link-88buttons">Freebies page</a>. The newest are in front, and I think you can really tell how much I have improved since those first buttons I shared.</p>
          <p><em>Third,</em> I am setting up at the winter-house, getting electricity back to work and acquiring some comfortable furniture since I will be staying here for a while. So in terms of planned updates it might be a bit slow. I might finish some of my current WIPs, of which I will share some sketches here:  </p>

          <p><em>So,</em> those are the updates for now. Thank you for reading ^^ </p>

          <p><em>Posted on 11.01.2026</em></p>
          <h3>Work in Progress Jan '26</h3>
          <p>A little bit of my works in progress in January. Some might be finished this month. Others are more ideas that are for further in the future.</p>
          <p><em>First,</em> I am constantly working and thinking about upgrading the website. My idea for version 2.0 is to have the different portfolio categories have their own themed layout. So I have made some sketches for that. Although I will not start actually working on coding version 2.0 until all the pages are up and running in version 1.2. </p>
        <img  src="https://file.garden/aE7eugw0EBvaQzOF/blog/2026/cloudydaysketch.webp" height="200" alt="sketch of a website layout with clouds" style="padding: 5px; float: left; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/>
          <p><em>Second, </em>I am working on expanding the amount of detail in my drawing from the *Walk in the Forest* universe I made this past November. I really like the colours and everything, but I always seem to give up once I have made 1-2 fairies. I want to try and improve the details in my bigger drawings, so that they become illustrations you can really stare at for a longer time. 
It's hard to see now, but up until now I have included one other fairy and some falling leaves. </p>

<p><em>Third,</em> I am working on making some more buttons to put on the *ABOUT* page, which will probably also be available on the *FOR YOU* as a freebie. I know that there are a lot of ready made buttons available already. But I like to try and make things for myself ^^</p>
<p><em>So,</em> those are the things I am working on this month. As I am also in the process of moving over to the winter-house, it's not a lot. But I wanted to give this update in any case. </p>

          <h3>Draw & Chat #1: New Year Resolutions</h3>
          <p>It is 2026, and this is my first blogpost! So stoked for it. I wanted to share a video I made for my old YT channel. Which I kind had to re-launch because I could not figure out where else to host my drawing videos. In it I chat a little bit about my New Year Resolutions (or intentions) and show you the process of me drawing a chibi version of my original character Chloe. Hope you like it!</p>
